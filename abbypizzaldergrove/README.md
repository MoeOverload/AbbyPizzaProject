## 🛠️ Customization

Want to tweak something? Here's where to look:
- **Text Content:** Edit the `.html` files directly.
- **Styles:** Modify `/assets/css/style.css`.
- **Images:** Replace or add new files inside `/images/`.
- **Scripts:** Add or adjust JavaScript in `/js/` if applicable.

## 🧠 Technical Notes

- Built with a mobile-first design philosophy.
- Basic SEO meta tags included (`viewport`, `description`, `charset`, etc.).
- Files named lowercase-with-hyphens for maximum compatibility.
- Minimal dependencies to keep loading fast and maintenance simple.
- Fully scalable: Duplicate an HTML file and adjust the content to create new pages easily.
